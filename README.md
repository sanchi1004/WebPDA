# Personal Portfolio

# Introduction
This is the journey of creating my personal portfolio website: My personal portfolio at (https://sanchi1004.github.io/WebPDA/). The goal was to build a simple yet professional site that highlights my skills, education, and contact details in an organized and visually appealing way.
It was primarily designed to serve for my Web Programming Course Digital Assignment.

## Design Choices  

1. Keeping It Clean & Minimal  
I wanted the site to be easy to navigate, so I kept the layout simple, ensuring visitors could find information without distractions.  

2. Icons for Better Readability
Instead of just using plain text, I added icons alongside key sections like skills and contact info. This makes the page more engaging and visually structured.

## Development Process  

1. Building the Structure (HTML)
   - Created an `index.html` file to hold sections for my introduction, skills, education, and contact details.  

2. Making It Look Good (CSS)
   - Designed a `styles.css` file to define colors, fonts, spacing, and overall styling.  

3. Adding Visual Appeal 
   - Included icons and images to make the site more interesting and professional-looking.  

4. Going Live/Deployment
   - Uploaded the project to GitHub and published it using GitHub Pages.

## Challenges Faced  

- Making it Mobile friendly
  Ensuring the layout worked well on all screen sizes took some trial and error. Some text and images had to be resized and adjusted.  

- Consistent Design 
  Finding the right colors, fonts, and spacing to keep everything looking clean and professional required a few iterations.  

- Placing Icons properly
  Making sure icons aligned well with the text without looking out of place took some extra styling effort.

## Future Improvements  

Showcasing My Projects – Adding a section to display my best work with links and descriptions.  
More Interactivity – Introducing cool features like modals or animations to make the site feel more dynamic.  
A Blog Section – Writing about my experiences, skills, and projects to keep the site fresh and engaging.  
A Contact Form– Making it easier for visitors to reach out directly from the website.  

This portfolio is just the beginning! I’ll keep improving and adding new features over time to make it even better.
